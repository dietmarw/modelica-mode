2023-01-07: Release of modelica-mode version 2.0.0

    - Rearchitected the code to follow Emacs conventions more closely:
      - All functions and variables start with modelica- instead of mdc-
      - C-h m now shows the list of keybindings
      - modelica-mode now inherits from prog-mode
      - Settings can be configured via M-x customize and overridden via file-
        or dir-local variables
    - Redesigned keybindings to follow the conventions of other major modes.
      Set modelica-use-emacs-keybindings to nil to use the old keybindings,
      except:
      - Replaced C-c C-h with C-c C-a since Emacs uses <anything> C-h to show
        help for available keystrokes
    - Support for hideshow-minor-mode added
    - oo-browser support is unmaintained (but left in the repository for now)
    - Removed compatibility code for XEmacs

04/25/01: Release of modelica-mode version 1.4.1

04/25/01: modelica-mode.el, br-mdc.el
    - don't define read-only or intangible property for hidden annotations
    - introduce constants mdc-class-keyword and mdc-class-modifier-keyword
      formerly defined in br-mdc.el
    - updates and fixes in mdc-indent-line, mdc-calculate-indent,
      mdc-statement-start, mdc-short-class-definition, mdc-forward-begin
    - add "." to word characters in mdc-mode-syntax-table
      (useful for treating names and numbers as words,
       as opposed to pure idents and integers)
